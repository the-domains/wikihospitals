Wikihospitals was inspired by Wikileaks and Wikipedia. It's aim is to promote transparency, public information, public debate and reform.

No other industry consumes so much money, is so secretive, has such a high error rate, is so over priced or so inefficiently run, as healthcare.

Public health systems were developed across western nations after World War II. They were meant to provide the returning soldiers with infection control and their families with safe maternity care.

70 years later we have a monster that is threatening to destabilize Western Civilization. The health budget in all Western nations is consuming up to 18% of the Gross Domestic Product and rising inextricably. Intensive Care Units, once designed to help young people survive polio are now filled with 80 and 90 year olds suffering diseases of old age, pneumonia, vascular disease and cancer.
