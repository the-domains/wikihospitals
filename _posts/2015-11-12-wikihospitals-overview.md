![Lack of international competition, secrecy about cost and effectiveness and the emotional impact of disease are a potent mix.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f471b6cb-9333-4c2d-b167-1b14314b92f7.jpg)

Unlike other industries, paying _more_ doesn't get you _better_ health care. Americans pay more than any other country, but see a Doctor less often, have lower life expectancies and higher infant mortality deaths than other western countries. 

The health industry is the 21st Century answer to the Aristocracy. Absolute power, no accountability. The health industry has control of governments across the globe, billions of dollars washing around in off shore trusts and complicated investment schemes, swarms of political lobbyists. Meanwhile patients die because they can't afford the absolute basics of health care. 

'Born to rule' is like 'greed is good'. It's a con. Open competition is the only way to drop prices and raises standards. 

As health care costs continue to skyrocket across the world, holding western countries to ransom and destroying their budgets, some simple facts are worth considering. 

Some of the biggest gains in extending life expectancy have come from broad-based, community projects. Immunisation programs. Clean water, removal of sewerage and disrupting the life cycle of parasites. Free and accessible treatments for young children. 

Some of the lowest gains in increasing life expectancy come from acute hospital treatments. Chemotherapy for low grade cancers, cardiac stenting for preventative treatments, intensive care treatments for elderly, frail people.

Hospitals continue to drain more and more from western health budgets. Yet their high tech, 7 o'clock news dramas and exploding staffing budgets provide very low outcomes.

Over-servicing is the reason the health industry has become the wealthiest sector in the Western world. Every health dollar wasted, is a dollar earned for a private company or government department.

"You have to start with the truth. The truth is the only way that we can get anywhere. Because any decision-making that is based upon lies or ignorance can't lead to a good conclusion." ― Julian Assange.
