Wikihospitals was inspired by Wikileaks and Wikipedia. The health industry is the last bastion of power, greed and secrets. Like the Catholic Church; the health industry hides its billion dollar financial deals, covers up incompetence staff and pretends that knowledge of disease and treatments is exclusive to its own secret club. 

The fact is that anyone can learn the basic steps of good, safe, affordable diagnosis and treatments. And one of the first things to learn is that the more you pay, the less you may receive, regarding quality and effective treatments. Over-servicing is the reason the health industry has become the wealthiest sector in the Western world. Every health dollar wasted, is a dollar earned for a private company or government department. 

"You have to start with the truth. The truth is the only way that we can get anywhere. Because any decision-making that is based upon lies or ignorance can't lead to a good conclusion."
â€• Julian Assange.

What are the actual steps that are meant to be followed during the process of diagnosis, treatment and follow-up? Is there a way to estimate risks of disease, considering family history, medical history, lifestyle, and fitness? What are the actual errors that happen to up to 50% of people along their treatment pathway? How can you save thousands of dollars and yet receive the best quality treatments? What are the health startups and how can they save you thousands of dollar and reduce your risk of hospital errors?

Hi, I'm Delia, a retired nurse who created Wikihospitals. After working in public hospitals in Australia and seeing some good (and bad) nursing and medical care, I was diagnosed with cancer. Pushed into the private sector by a well-meaning GP I experienced dreadful cancer treatment. Six months later I was $10,000 out of pocket (despite paying for private insurance for 20 years). 

I investigated the booming Australian private health sector and why it costs so much, yet provides so little. It turned out that my private oncologist had a public practice less than half a mile from his lucrative private clinic. His public patients received safe, accurate treatment, due to computerised drug charts and highly trained nursing staff. His private patients received shabby, dangerous treatment and a raft of unnecessary, but expensive tests and distressing treatments. The reason? 

Secrets.  

Wikihospitals started as a general blog in 2012\. By the end of 2015 it will match up Australian health startups by medical speciality, along with common errors and where to find Best Practice Guidelines. In 2016, I hope to turn it into a database linked app. Eventually, I hope to raise funds and make Wikihospitals a fully fledged startup. I's like to offer a subscription service that creates an individual profile and guides people towards cheaper, safer and more home-based health services. 

I promote health startups as a cheaper and more accurate alternative to managing disease and treatments. The fact is that modern, technology-driven services provide the accurate data that mainstream health services often don't have. 

'Startups' are a new movement sweeping across the world. The term startup refers to a new type of business model. Technology orientated, customer focused and prepared to challenge directly old fashion, over-priced and rigid businesses. This is unlike most traditional health services that are orientated around doctors and hospitals.
