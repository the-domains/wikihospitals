Medical diagnosis and treatments don't have to mean bricks and mortar hospitals, thousands of dollars worth of bills, and hours waiting for the Doctor or the nurse to turn up.

From Scanadu Scout, to Isabel the diagnosis checklist and Medical Teleconferencing, people can finally leave behind old fashion hospital beds. Stay home and use high tech services to monitor you conditions, check your treatments and stay in touch via the internet.

Keep Parkinson's medication doses more accurate with Global Kinetics. Accurately assess your falls risks with Quanticare. Check your risk of anaemia with Eyenemia. 

Safer, home based, more accurate. That's health startups. The future.
