> Type 1 diabetes can now be managed safely

![Safe, accurate diabetic care can be delivered by low cost, high tech Health Startups](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3fd3ae38-8518-4170-b8a9-18650260b429.jpg)

[Predictbgl][0] is an innovative Australian company helping thousands of people around the world predict their future blood sugar levels

Accurate medical diagnosis and effective treatments don't have to mean expensive and hard to reach hospitals, thousands of dollars of confusing medical bills, and hours wasted in busy waiting rooms and corridors.

Most diseases are chronic, and require on-going management. And one of the biggest problem is keeping an accurate tab on people's day to day progress and their medication intake. 
> 
> Health information has often been inaccurate, out of date and irrelevant

In traditional medicine, patients would go to see a Doctor once every six months. The doctor would possibly order one minor test (like a blood test), perform another minor test (physical exam) and talk to the patient (about their general health and social chat). The data provided would be a tiny, subjective often irrelevant snapshot of one specific moment in time.

Enter health startups.
![Wikihospitals interviews Simon Carter, creator of Predictbgl.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/82219644-691c-45fe-b785-0693dd8e0e0c.png)

Information can now be monitored continuously. It can be coordinated, cross referenced against a wide range of other data (medications, expected progress, side effects). This data gives both the Doctor and the patient a universe of data that simply was not available before.

> Accurate data means more accurate treatments

Health data companies are created by people with science, computer and technology skills. They tend to be a fragmented range of tiny businesses that solve one specific customer or patient problem. Due to their high use of technology and smart phone orientation these business are often called startups.

> From predicting future blood sugar levels to estimating future risk of cancers, startups are reforming health care

Many of the most innovative health startups are coming from smaller countries like Australia and Israel. Keep Parkinson's medication doses more accurate with [Global Kinetics][1]. Accurately assess your falls risks with [Quanticare][2]. Assess cardiac conditions with [StethoCloud][3]. Coming up is the ability to use a smart phone to assess your risk of anaemia with [Eyenemia.][4]

Safer, cheaper, home based and accurate. That's health startups. The future.
