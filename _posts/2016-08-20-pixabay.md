> Health care is supposed to send you broke, right?

> Wrong. Everything in healthcare, from the cost of a hip replacement to a script for Digoxin, one of the oldest medications in the world, varies dramatically from one country to another. The reason? The health industry is used to controlling entire markets and charging what they think they can get away with. But that's not the way things work for any other industry. So why should health care be different? People just need to be prepared to shop around and get the best price. And just like kids clothing and cameras, shopping on-line can save time and money.

> Medical tourism has the ability to drop prices and give patients/consumers more power over their bills. After all, most private healthcare services have hidden out of pocket costs and in many cases, they run into thousands. Why pay more than you have to?

> Medical tourism companies include [HealthBase][0] and [Medigo,][1][Narayana][2] and [Patients beyond Boarders][3].

> In Australia the feisty private insurer [NIB][4] has started to offer packages for it's customers to go to Asia for non urgent procedures. The Australian Medical Associations have rushed to condemn the medical tourism industry. But do they have to pay their own and often substantial out of pocket bills? No. A friend recently went into a private hospital in Melbourne for a hip replacement. Even _with top cover_, the 'pay before you walk' price was $5000\. And that didn't cover the anaesthetists fees, surgeons fees etc. 
> 
> Australian surgeons are still resisting pressure from consumer groups to publicly declare their out of pocket costs. They probably don't want the competition that transparency will bring. This is why health costs are so high and continue to rise, year after year. Secrecy of the seller means unnecessarily high costs for the buyer.
> 
> It's time for a change. Medical tourism promises to bring international competition to the secretive, over-priced and error prone health industry. 
> 
> Bring it on.
