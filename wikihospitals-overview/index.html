After working in public hospitals in Australia and seeing some good (and bad) nursing and medical care, I was diagnosed with cancer. Pushed into the private sector by a well-meaning GP I experienced dreadful cancer treatment. Six months later I was $10,000 out of pocket (despite paying for private insurance for 20 years). </p><p>I investigated the booming Australian private health sector and why it costs so much, yet provides so little. It turned out that my private oncologist had a public practice less than half a mile from his lucrative private clinic. His public patients received safe, accurate treatment, due to computerised drug charts and highly trained nursing staff. His private patients received shabby, dangerous treatment and a raft of unnecessary, but expensive tests and distressing treatments. The reason? </p><p>Secrets.  </p><p>Wikihospitals started as a general blog in 2012. By the end of 2015 it will match up Australian health startups by medical speciality, along with common errors and where to find Best Practice Guidelines. In 2016, I hope to turn it into a database linked app. Eventually, I hope to raise funds and make Wikihospitals a fully fledged startup. I's like to offer a subscription service that creates an individual profile and guides people towards cheaper, safer and more home-based health services. </p><p>I promote health startups as a cheaper and more accurate alternative to managing disease and treatments. The fact is that modern, technology-driven services provide the accurate data that mainstream health services often don't have. </p><p>‘Startups’ are a new movement sweeping across the world. The term startup refers to a new type of business model. Technology orientated, customer focused and prepared to challenge directly old fashion, over-priced and rigid businesses.
